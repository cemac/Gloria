This is the code to calcluate the CO2 footprint of industries using the Leontief matrix method.
This has been adapted from code given to use by SRI and was using very large matrices which contained many 0s.
This code has been modified to create new versions of functions to just use the required parts of the large matrix in an attempt to reduce both time and memory use
